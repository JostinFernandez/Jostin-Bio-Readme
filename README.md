Hello, I'm **Jostin Fernandez**, and I'm currently part of the *Karim Kharbouch Coding Fellowship in Newark*. I'm diving into the world of coding and software development, and learning GitHub is a big part of my journey. 

Here’s what I’m hoping to get out of it:

1. **Keep My Projects Organized**: I want to use GitHub to keep track of changes in my code and make sure everything is tidy and under control.
2. **Work with Others**: GitHub will help me collaborate with other developers, contribute to cool open-source projects, and work smoothly with my team.
3. **Manage Projects Better**: I plan to use GitHub’s tools to manage my projects, track issues, and make my workflow more efficient.
4. **Learn from the Community**: GitHub has a huge community of developers, and I’m excited to learn from their code and contribute my own projects.

I’m really looking forward to mastering GitHub and seeing where it takes my coding career!
